# Fantasy Duels!
This project was made as the last project for IMC Summer semester 2024
Welcome to this little fantasy duel game where you fight procedurally generated enemies  in a rogue-like-ish experience.

There will be an in-depth wiki pointing out all the different things you can do and giving info and details on game mechanics.
